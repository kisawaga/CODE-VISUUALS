Health Insurance Cost Analysis
This project explores how individual characteristics such as age, BMI, smoking status, and region influence medical insurance charges. Using Python and Power BI, the project identifies key cost drivers to support data-driven decisions in health insurance.

-Objectives
Perform descriptive analysis to understand variable distributions

Detect and handle outliers using the IQR method

Analyze relationships (e.g., smoking vs. charges)

Visualize insights using Power BI

Identify key predictors of medical costs

-Dataset
Source: Kaggle – Health Insurance Dataset

Records: 1,338 individuals

Features:

age: Age of the insured (18–64)

sex: Gender

bmi: Body Mass Index

children: Number of dependents

smoker: Smoker status

region: U.S. region

charges: Medical insurance costs

-Tools Used
Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)

Jupyter Notebook

Power BI

Git & GitHub

-Key Insights
Smokers are charged significantly more than non-smokers

BMI and age strongly correlate with higher charges

Regional and gender-based variations are also notable

Power BI visualizations provide intuitive trend analysis
